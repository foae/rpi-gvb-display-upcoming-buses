# Next GVB bus
### Warning: this is just a weekend hack, use at own risk.

This code is used to display the upcoming buses for a GVB station on a LED panel (Unicorn pHAT/HAT) using Raspberry Pi Zero W, Golang, GVB Maps Websockets (more as a proof of concept) and OVAPI.

OVAPI: https://github.com/skywave/KV78Turbo-OVAPI/wiki  
Be sure to read their docs and not bash the API.
